# Simple react-rails demo app

A simple app that integrates Rails 5 with the react-rails gem.

Originally created for a talk at the [Ann Arbor Ruby Meetup](http://a2rb.org/).

## Setup

Make sure you have rails and postgres installed.  Clone repo into a new directory.  Copy the .env.example file to create a .env file with your local postgres credentials.  Then, setup the database and start the server.

```
$ bundle install
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
$ rails db:seed
$ rails s
```
